Changes to package FrF2 

The package is still under development. 
Suggestions and bug reports are very welcome.

31/01/2011, Version 1.2-1
  - made run.no.in.std.order a factor with properly ordered levels 
    for functions pb, FrF2 and FrF2Large
  - made option res3 of function FrF2 effective also for MaxC2 
    (maximization among all designs instead of highest resolution only)
  - introduced function BsProb.design for convenient application of the 
    Box and Meyer Bayesian screening method from package BsMD to FrF2 and 
    pb designs

30/10/2010, Version 1.2
 This version update adds many larger designs and functionality for them.
  - added a function FrF2Large for large designs,
    either manually-specified or resolution V based on Sanchez and Sanchez (2005)
  - added a function nrunsV for telling users how many runs are needed for a 
    resolution V design, with what method, and whether it is MA
  - added some internal functions and modified internal function 
    gen.check to become independent of the Yates object
    in order to increase run size that can be treated (by function FrF2Large)
  - updated catlg: 
    - added known MA resolution IV designs in 256 and 512 runs
      according to Xu (2009) and Ryan and Bulutoglu (2010; their appendix)
    - added further good resolution IV designs in 256 (up to 80 factors) and 
      512 runs (up to 160 factors) from the Xu (2009) paper
    - modified catlg in order to have a "1" added for those previously avaialable
      designs that have been proven to be MA (1024 to 4096 runs), 
      and added improved MA designs to catalogue (cf. Ryan and Bulutoglu, appendix);
    - unified catalogue notation between designs larger than 128 and designs up to 128
      (used the notation from up to 128 (also used in FrF2.catlg128), i.e. 
      clear.2fis always as matrix and all.2fis.clear as "all" in case of resolution V
      or higher)
    - documented extended range of additional MA designs


09/09/2010, Version 1.1-5
- added references to technical reports in help files for estimable 2fis, 
  design catalogue and fractional factorial design generation

03/08/2010, Version 1.1-4
- reformatted NEWS file for improving display with news() function
- modified function aliasprint
- added class aliases to output objects of function aliases
- added print method for class aliases
- improvements to DanielPlot.design, MEPlot.design and IAPlot.design 
  and DanielPlot.default, MEPlot.default and IAPlot.default (thanks to 
  Andrea Bernasconi for instigating these): 
  - functions DanielPlot.design, MEPlot.design and IAPlot.design now also work 
    for full factorials with only 2-level factors
  - functions DanielPlot.default, MEPlot.default and IAPlot.default give more 
    meaningful error message, if called with invalid object type

25/06/2010, Version 1.1-3
- bug fix: labels on interaction plots for levels of selected factors 
  were wrong, if not the first few factors got selected.

25/06/2010, Version 1.1-2
- bug fixes: 
  - MEPlot, IAPlot and DanielPlot did not work 
    on designs in wide formal with aggregated responses from 
    repeated measurements, because of an abbreviated name for 
    the list element response.names in the design.info attribute

23/04/2010, Version 1.1-1
- added the minimum run size for a clear design 
  to the output object of function compromise and 
  an optional message to this effect
- added catlg.name element to design information for FrF2 designs, 
  in case select.catlg has been used (important for summary.design 
  to properly exploit the design name)
- added 30 further designs in 128 runs to catlg, 
  based on their potential for clear compromise designs
bug fixes: 
- select.catlg did not work properly in function FrF2 
  (which was presumably not consequential, 
  because so far no alternative catalogues were provided)
- print.catlg did not work for non-default catalogues, 
  if nruns was specified

24/02/2010, Version 1.1
- added large (good but not necessarily MA) resolution V designs from Xu 2009, 
  added hint to even larger non-regular resolution V designs in package 
  DoE.base (from version 0.9-16)
- supported subsequent calculation of generator information for blocked 
  and splitplot designs by updated function summary.design:
  - added map element to design.info for split-plot designs and blocked designs 
    created with blockpick.big
  - modified base.design entry of design.info object for split-plot designs 
    with specified generators: display the original generators in the 
    base design, which is much more logical than presenting the generators 
    after application of splitpick which were there before
  - added an FrF2.version element to design.info in order to allow checking 
    whether the generators can be reconstructed from stored information 
    with function generator.design from package DoE.base
  - added test cases for this feature
Bug fixes:
- SERIOUS BUG: manually specifying dependent block generators led to unwarned 
  mismatch between ouput design and design.info; 
  fixed by throwing an error in case of dependent block generators
- documentation of block option for FrF2 was confusing regarding 
  interpretation of entries in numeric vectors
- made large generator vectors work 
  (length >20 was an issue and led to an error)
- documentation of function FrF2 wrongly called 
  generators element of design.info attribute gen.display
- blockpick full factorial example in manual was (very) old state 
  and worked different from description
- For split-plot designs, the automatic choice of whole plot factors 
  was not always as documented; sometimes, the whole plot factors were not 
  the first nfac.WP ones.
- inconsistency: splitpick.out used drop=FALSE for gen, but not for perms;
  now also introduced drop=FALSE for the other similar functions (leftadjust,
  blockpick.big)
- split-plot designs and designs with hard-to-change factors 
  should now also work for full factorial situations.

17/01/2010, Version 1.0-5
- internal function double.des was changed to produce different designs 
  for 40,56,64,88,96 runs: The folded columns are in the front rather 
  than in the rear, with the benefit of obtaining resolution IV designs 
  whenever the number of factors is up to half the number of runs

02/01/2010, Version 1.0-4
- function compromise for supporting creation of compromise designs
- bug fix: distinct design with only one 2fi did not work

10/12/2009, Version 1.0-3
- bug fix: desnum attribute was list instead of data frame 
  for FrF2 with estimability requirements

26/11/2009, Version 1.0-2
- added a response argument to MEPlot, IAPlot and DanielPlot
- bug fix for function FrF2: resolution requests were ignored since 
  version 0.97-7
- small documentation bug fixes

17/11/2009, Version 1.0-1
- clarified in the explanation of the catalogue file 
  that the resolution III designs constructed for 64 and 128 runs are 
  in fact minimum aberration 
  (which was only conjectured before)
- bug fix for function DanielPlot.design: the function did not work
  for large numbers of factors

08/10/2009, Version 1.0
- added methods for class design for the plotting functions 
  MEPlot, IAPlot and DanielPlot
- added the MA resolution III designs for 64 runs (33 to 63 factors) 
  and 128 runs (65 to 127 factors) to the design catalogue catlg
  (strictly speaking, it is only proven that these have the same number of 
  length three and length four words as the MA designs)
- improved documentation of generators option for FrF2
- removed unnecessary warning from FrF2 in case of more than 19 generators

17/09/2009, Version 0.97-10
- changed a link to DoE.base-package to work on Mac-OS

14/09/2009, Version 0.97-9
- made factor names in FrF2 and pb valid names using make.names, 
  also block.name in FrF2

07/09/2009, Version 0.97-8
- made function FrF2 output factors also for full factorial 2-level designs
  without center points and documented coding of experimental factors for 
  functions FrF2 and pb
  (thanks to Enrico Pegoraro for reporting this inconsistency)
- fixed a bug in function pb's treatment of unnamed lists as factor.names
- added a few links to manuals

24/08/2009, Version 0.97-7
- made functions FrF2 and pb tolerate factor.names to be an unnamed list
- bug fix: resolution option for FrF2 did not return a full factorial,
  if no smaller design of the desired resolution exists
- documentation bug fix: value section for function FrF2 did not 
  mention the design.info elements map, clear and res3 for designs created 
  with option estimable

21/08/2009, Version 0.97-6
- bug fix: generators.from.design did not work for replications 
  in case of designs with the estimable option
- bug fix: check rejected some valid linear models with 
  only complete aliases due to numerical inaccuracies

21/08/2009, Version 0.97-5
- developed find.gen and generators.from.design to 
  support generation of ccd designs (including estimable and blocked designs)

21/08/2009, Version 0.97-4
- bug fix: FrF2 always randomized designs when using the estimable option, 
  even for randomize=FALSE

20/08/2009, Version 0.97-3
- changed itemize to describe in Rd files for pb and CatalogueAccessors in order 
  to comply with new R CMD check behavior

19/08/2009, Version 0.97-2
- blocked designs: added the element block.gen to the design.info attribute 
  in order to support subsequent augmentation with star points
- added error message for missing ncenter for add.center
- added meaningful error message for failure for full factorials to fold.design
- removed warning about all center points together, if ncenter=1
- made internal function des.recode identical to same function in package DoE.base,
  in order to later drop it from FrF2
- bugfix: names (not values) from factor.names were ignored in some important situations for blocked designs
  (automatic factor selection, small case, i.e. where blockpick is used)
- added experimental and as yet undocumented internal functions for extracting 
  all relevant generators from designs especially where these are not obvious 
  (find.gen and generators.from.design) 

16/08/2009, Version 0.97-1
- bug fix: folding and center points did not work for full factorial 2-level designs

13/08/2009, Version 0.97
- added function fold.design for foldover designs
- added functions add.center for adding center points and iscube for identfying 
  the cube points in a design with center points
- added functionality for center points to functions FrF2 and pb
- function aliases has gained the new argument condense that makes 
  its output very similar to that of internal function alias3fi in combination 
  with code=TRUE
- moved into the direction of unified representation of aliased element in design.info 
  (still not the same for all types of design, particularly not for blocked designs)
- modified nfactors in design.info for blocked designs to refer to treatment factors only
  (ntreat kept for continuity)
- added keyword internal to help files for internal functions
- bug fix: added nfactors to design.info for split-plot designs
- bug fix: generators element of design.info was labelled wrongly 
  for more than 50 factors (NA labels for factors 51 and following)

03/08/2009, Version 0.96-1
- added meaningful error message for IAPlot in case of no 2-factor interactions
- adjusted test output to new version of DoE.base
- bugfix for MacOS: replaced log2(nruns) with rounded version for print.catlg, 
  because otherwise wrong result on MacOS

31/07/2009, Version 0.96
- changed R version to R-2.8.0 or newer (extractor for class design does not work 
  with earlier versions)
- added dependence to R version 2.7.1 or newer
- a few clarifications in documentation
- added legend element to element aliased in design.info for FrF2 designs
- made seed occur on all design.info objects for function FrF2 
- added nfactors to design.info objects for blocked designs
- made repeat.only FALSE even if user made it TRUE for between block replications 
  only, where in fact there are no repeated measurements
- bugfix:designs with 20 or more generators did not work in function FrF2

13/07/2009, Version 0.95
- included Bobby Mees very comprehensive new book into the references
- included design 3-1.1 (cf. program in FrF2-devel) into catlg 
  in support of future implementation of inner/outer array designs
- included possibility to select factors for which interactions are 
  to be plotted in IAPlot (was already available in MEPlot)
- all experimental factors are now R factors in the data frame, 
  even if their levels are numerical values
Bugfixes:
- provided meaningful error message for internal function formula2matrix, 
  if user specified the formula for estimable in an inappropriate way
- pb design with 8 runs and <=4 factors now effectively is the FrF2 design, 
  with all FrF2 properties, as was already documented before. 

06/07/2009, Version 0.94-1
Bugfix: Replicated blocks had the same block number or name in case of bbreps. 
  This is unreasonable and has been changed; with the changed version, the 
  blocking variable can be directly used in a (mixed) linear model analysis.

28/06/2009, Version 0.94
- added element creator to design.info attribute of designs created by 
  functions FrF2 and pb, and documented objects accordingly; this element 
  contains the call, but is called creator to allow it also to include 
  stored menu settings instead
- added possibility to have negative generators (e.g. -ABD or -c(1,2,4))
  (before, levels had to be swapped) 
- improved usage comfort and documentation for split plot designs in function 
  FrF2 (with WPfacs, specification of nfac.WP is no longer necessary; 
  the documentation of this aspect has been confusing and has been improved) 
- started decoupling statistical and technical information in the documentation;
  purpose of this: shorter individual help texts and the possibility to re-use 
  the statistical texts for help from within R-commander in future package 
  RcmdrPlugin.DoE 
- a few further improvements to the documentation have been made
- modified function remodel to allow numeric variables with two levels 
  not equal to -1 and 1 
- improvement of MEPlot: user can select effects to be displayed (option select) 
  (a similar possibility for IAPlot is not in place yet; so far, the model has 
  to be reduced in order to select effects for IAPlot)
Bugfix: function DanielPlot gave error message in case 
  of non-significant effects only

24/05/2009, Version 0.93
- The constant Letters and some functions have been moved to new package DoE.base, 
  in preparation of the collaborating package group of FrF2, DoE.base, DoE.wrapper and 
  RcmdrPlugin.DoE.
- documentation of factor.names in UtilitiesCat.Rd has been corrected 
  (not user-relevant, as affected function estimable.check is not to be called 
  directly by users)
- removed unnecessary suggests for BHH2

18/05/2009, Version 0.92-5
Bugfixes 
- simultaneous specification of nfactors and nlevels of length > 1 did not work 
  in internal function fac.design;
  this was not relevant for FrF2, but nevertheless wrong
- estimable did not work with a formula using factor names rather than factor letters;
  this has been fixed, and an example with this feature has been added
- catalogue catlg currently contains only one design each for large resolution V+ 
  situations (256 runs and more). The documentation of this aspect has been corrected.
- deleted wrong statement in the documentation, that the complete catalogue of 
  128 run resolution IV designs with up to 24 factors is downloadable from the 
  authors website (it is simply too large and could not be uploaded)

15/05/2009, Version 0.92-4
Bugfixes and small changes regarding row numbering
- third column of run.order for blocked designs was wrong
- added original row number of design to columns 1 and 3 of run.order in case 
  of blocked and split-plot designs
- row numbers of design itself and attribute desnum unified to always be the numbering 
  from 1 to number of rows (i.e. second column of 
  attribute run.order) regardless of design

07/05/2009, Version 0.92-2
Bug fixes
- blockpick.big displayed wrong information about which effects 
  are aliased with blocks; corrected; 
  this bug only affected direct use of function blockpick.big
  and did not affect any automatic calculations within FrF2, 
  alias information in design.info attribute was always correct.
- replication information attached to run order also for full factorial 
  designs and Plackett-Burman designs (functions fac.design (used by FrF2) 
  and pb)
- corrected documentation of class design and functions pb and 
  FrF2 regarding the run.order attribute of class design output 
  (from 2-column matrix to 3-column data frame 
  with third column including replication information)

01/05/2009, Version 0.92-1
Bug fixes
- hard to change factor number equal to nfactors gave indexing error;
  prevented by error message, since this does not make sense anyway
- hard to change order was not the intended one --> changed

30/04/2009, Version 0.92
Substantial additions to function FrF2:
- split-plot and blocking facilities
    including also functions splitpick, blockpick, blockpick.big
    and leftadjust that investigate the structure of 
    designs and may be useful for expert users
- treatment of hard-to-change factors 
Further changes to function FrF2 and its output:
- made output object (class design) more informative
- row numbers of design reflect replication structure
- option select.catlg moved to an earlier position, 
  and made effective for more scenarios than before
Additions to catalogues and catalogue utilities:
- added print method for objects of class catlg in 
  support of inspecting available catalogue entries
- extended standard catalogue catlg by some good larger designs
Improvements to further utility functions:
- added accessor functions for class design
- added contrast contr.FrF2 for -1/+1 contrasts
  in line with 2-level fractional factorials
- made character vectors in class design data frames 
  from package FrF2 into factors with contrasts contr.FrF2
- made internal function alias3fi capable of handling more than 
  50 factors
Bug fixes to documentation and error messages
added examples and test cases (tests directory)

far too many changes to be all mentioned in detail

15/04/2009, Version 0.91-1
Bug fix in documentation to function FrF2 

06/04/2009, Version 0.91
Additions to function FrF2: 
- added functionality for "estimable", i.e. automated search  
  for designs that accommodate certain 2-factor interactions (2fis) well 
  (two approaches)
- added possibility of replications and repeated measurements
- added more design information to output of FrF2 and changed 
  output from list to data frame with attributes of new class design
- FrF2 now also can do full factorials
- renamed option max.nclear.2fis to MaxC2 (often used in the literature)
Additions to function pb: 
- added possibility of replications and repeated measurements
Further changes:
- modified function alias3fi (non-exported function) to allow allow 
 reducing detail to order=2
- renamed catlg elements around clear 2fis to read "clear" and not "free",
  accessor functions analogously
- grouped R-utility functions in files according to same pattern as 
  in Rd files
- changed output of pb also to data frame with attributes of class design
- extensions and clarifications for documentation
- switched to FrF2, if pb is called for nruns=8 and nfactors<=4
Bug fixes:
- FrF2 code had gen instead of generators in two places
- pb had a bug that prevented design generation 
  for those numbers of runs for which doubling is used 
  (40, 56,64,88,96)

24/03/2009, Version 0.9-1
A few minor bug fixes: 
- Changed R version the package depends on to 2.7.0 
  (packages BsMD and scatterplot3d require this version),
  and added LazyLoad: yes and LazyData: yes to 
  DESCRIPTION file
- tried to fix example error for Mac: 
  round instead of floor in check for nruns in FrF2,
  also changed check for nruns in pb
- Bug fix on WLP.catlg, free.2fis.catlg and all.2fis.free.catlg: 
  now always return a named list, 
  even if the catlg object has only one element
- minor clarifications in documentation

11/03/2009, Version 0.9
Added functionality for creating designs: 
- FrF2 and pb create 
  regular and non-regular fractional factorials with 2-level 
  factors, together with a number of utility functions. 

16/02/2008, Version 0.8
- added function for cube plots for showing means or fitted means 
  for three-way-interactions
- corrected bugs in documentation: plot functions MEPlot and 
  IAPlot do not take ... argument, and they were wrongly 
  referenced by their early development names "iap" and "mep" 
  in a few places 
- line width (lwd) choosable in MEPlot and IAPlot (affects plot 
  lines and axis thickness)
- title size of individual plots (cex.main) choosable in MEPlot
- legend in diagonal panels of interaction plot matrix (IAPlot) 
  improved
- alias numbers in interaction plots (in case of 
  show.alias=TRUE) sized by cex.lab
- right outer margin slightly increased for making outer border 
  visible in copied figures

16/12/2007, Version 0.7
Bug-fix: functions DanielPlot and IAPlot did not work with aov 
  objects but only with pure lm-objects. This has been fixed by 
  letting the internal function remodel transform aov objects 
  into pure lm objects.

16/12/2007, Version 0.6 
- Eliminated portability issue with example: Version 0.5 used 
  windows() for opening several graphics devices.

15/12/2007, Version 0.5
First version on CRAN
